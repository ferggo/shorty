# Running this Application

To make things convenient, there is a `Makefile` included. To get started after
cloning the repo, run `make setup`. This assumes you already have Docker and
Docker-Compose installed.

After that's done, you can run the server container using `make server`, and it
will be listening on http://localhost:4000 by default.

The tests can be run via `make test`.

Normally, I wouldn't do this for local development because it's very slow to
iterate and frustrating to troubleshoot issues that come up. The reason I set
it up this way is to demonstrate how that would work for a more production-like
deployment.

For local development, I'd actually recommend that you install `asdf` so that you can do something like:

```
asdf install # This will install appropriate versions based on the .tool-versions file
mix deps.get
iex -S mix phx.server
```

This will similarly run the server outside of Docker on port 4000, but you'll need to have Postgres running locally.
You can do that quite easily using the included `docker-compose.yml`:

```
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

To run the tests outside of Docker, it's simply:

```
mix test
```

# Design notes

I wanted to demonstrate how to set up the entire stack, including:

* Deployment with Docker
* Phoenix back-end
* Ecto for database persistence
* JavaScript front-end (I used LiveView for this)
* CSS via TailwindCSS
* Unit / Controller testing via ExUnit
* End-to-End testing via Wallaby (timed out trying to troubleshoot this)

I feel like I accomplished those goals well. If I had more time to spend on the
project, I would have spent some more time on structured logging, distributed
tracing, and better metrics-collection. I spent a lot of time fighting with
Docker and dusting off front-end JS / CSS skills that I haven't used in a long
time, as well as learning how to use LiveView. I also hit some issues getting
ChromeDriver to work reliably via Wallaby, but I decided to just stop trying to
solve that because I had already invested a lot of time in this exercise.
